id: "ISSUE-001"
title: "Window thumbnails not displaying in Source Picker"
status: complete
priority: p1
epic: "EPIC-007"
type: bug
description: |
  In the Source Picker modal, when switching to the "Windows" tab, the window
  thumbnails are not displayed. The window names appear correctly, but the
  thumbnail images show as broken/empty placeholders.
  
  The Screens tab appears to work correctly with thumbnails visible.
steps_to_reproduce:
  - "Click the Record button"
  - "Source Picker modal opens"
  - "Click on the 'Windows' tab"
  - "Observe that window cards show names but no thumbnail images"
expected_behavior: "Each window card should display a live thumbnail preview of the window content"
actual_behavior: "Window cards show broken image placeholders instead of thumbnails"
workaround: null
