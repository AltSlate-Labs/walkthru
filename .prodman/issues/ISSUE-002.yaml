title: "MP4 conversion fails during ffmpeg-wasm load"
status: planning
priority: p1
epic: "EPIC-009"
type: bug
description: |
  WebM to MP4 conversion fails because ffmpeg-wasm is initialized without
  explicit local core paths, which depends on runtime loading behavior that
  does not reliably resolve in the current app environment.
steps_to_reproduce:
  - "Record a video and stop recording to open preview."
  - "Click Convert to MP4."
  - "Wait for converter loading phase."
expected_behavior: "Conversion completes and prompts user to save an MP4 file."
actual_behavior: "Conversion fails before completion and MP4 output is not produced."
workaround: "Save recording as WebM."
