  Add quality presets (720p/1080p @ 15/30/60fps) and file size
  estimation to give users control over recording quality while keeping
  WebM as the only recording output format.

  Features:
  - Three quality presets: Low (720p/15fps), Medium (1080p/30fps), High (1080p/60fps)
  - File size estimation before recording (displays MB/min)
  - New recordings save in WebM format only
  - Existing MP4 recordings remain visible and playable/exportable
  - Quality preference persists across app restarts (localStorage)
  - Default to Medium quality (1080p/30fps)
acceptance_criteria:
  - "Quality selector appears in idle state with 3 options"
  - "Selected preset is visually indicated"
  - "Recording resolution matches selected preset"
  - "Recording framerate matches preset (15/30/60fps)"
  - "Quality preference persists across app restarts"
  - "Default is Medium (1080p/30fps)"
  - "Size estimate displays in idle state (e.g., ~1.5 MB/min)"
  - "Estimate updates when quality preset or audio toggle changes"
  - "Preview screen shows Save as WebM button"
  - "New recordings are saved as .webm files"
  - "Existing .mp4 files appear in recordings list"
  - "Both .webm and existing .mp4 files can be played and managed"
  - "Export uses file-extension-appropriate save filters for .webm and .mp4"
