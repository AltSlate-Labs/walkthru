# DEC-001: Desktop Framework Selection

## Status

**Accepted** — 2026-01-17

## Context

We need to choose a desktop application framework for building a local-first screen recording application. The app needs to:
- Run on macOS (MVP), Windows (post-MVP)
- Access system screen capture APIs
- Have fast startup time
- Support modern web technologies

## Decision Drivers

- Development speed for MVP
- Cross-platform support
- Access to native APIs (screen capture, file system)
- Bundle size and startup performance
- Community and ecosystem maturity
- Team familiarity with web technologies

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Electron

**Pros:**
- Mature ecosystem with extensive documentation
- Full access to Node.js APIs
- Large community and plugin ecosystem
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Easy integration with React/Vite
- Built-in auto-updater

**Cons:**
- Larger bundle size (~150MB)
- Higher memory footprint
- Chromium overhead

### Option 2: Tauri

**Pros:**
- Much smaller bundle size (~10MB)
- Lower memory usage
- Rust-based security benefits
- Growing ecosystem

**Cons:**
- Less mature than Electron
- Smaller community
- More complex native API integration
- Steeper learning curve for Rust parts

### Option 3: Neutralino

**Pros:**
- Very small bundle size
- Lightweight runtime

**Cons:**
- Limited native API access
- Smaller ecosystem
- Less suitable for media-heavy apps

## Decision

**Electron** is selected for the MVP.

Rationale:
1. Fastest path to MVP with proven screen capture capabilities
2. Team familiarity with web technologies
3. Extensive documentation for media APIs
4. Well-understood deployment and auto-update patterns
5. Can revisit Tauri post-MVP if bundle size becomes critical

## Consequences

- Bundle size will be ~150MB (acceptable for desktop app)
- Higher memory usage than native alternatives
- Fast development velocity
- Easy to find developers familiar with the stack
- Well-documented path for Windows support post-MVP
